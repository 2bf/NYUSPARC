# NYU SPARC
I attended NYU Tandon's SPARC (Summer Program in Automation, Robotics, and Coding) summer program during the summer of 2023. Over the course of 2 weeks, I worked on electronics, circuitry, robotics, programming, Arduino microcontrollers/sensors, and VEX robots with other students.
This was a pretty cool experience for me, I had previous experience in programming and electrical engineering but no experience in robotics and competitive robots.

This is a compilation of some of the programs I wrote during the program.
